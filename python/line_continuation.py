# 1. use  ( ).  Use parentheses
# It is preferred to use () rather than \.
# In Python, you can freely break the line in parentheses ((), {}, []). Using this rule, you can use parentheses instead of backslashes.
# Since {} is used for set and [] is used for list, use () for such purpose.

a = ( 1 + 2
     + 3
     + 10 )
print(a)

# 2. Use a backslash (\)
a = 1 + 2 \
+ 3 \
+ 10 

print(a)
