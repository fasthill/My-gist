Step 1 – Find the custom.js
  # jupyter --config-dir   (jupyter설치 폴더 위치찾는 명령어)
Step 2 – Open custom.js which is inside <path>/.jupyter/custom directory.
  It could be possible that you don’t have the custom directory inside .jupyter or custom.js inside the custom directory. 
  In either case, just create what is not already present.
  Note – If the custom.js is not present in the custom directory,
  then create a new file, add the above code to that file. Finally save and close.
  
 That’s all, folks !!!
